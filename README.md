# YOLO v3 using CNTK written in C#
This is an ongoing project with the goal of implmenting YOLOv3 using [CNTK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/) and written in C#

The implementation is based on [Tutorial on implmenting YOLO v3 from scratch in PyTorch](https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-object-detector-in-pytorch/)
